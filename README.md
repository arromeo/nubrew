# NuBrew (Craft Beer Application - React Native)

NuBrew is an application that allows users to vote on their craft beer drinks and keep track of favorited drinks over time. As users expand their set of craft beers tried over time, the application will provide recommendations based on their previous likes based on IBU and category/style of drink. Of course, users need to be able to take that plunge and explore uncharted territories by trying something new by random as well, even if they really don't like that one style, taste changes over time!

We want to make it as easy as possible, so for those that bought their drinks with labels, the application was created while experimenting machine learning and label recognition using Google AutoML Vision.

# To get started

Please note that we unfortunately cannot provide access to the camera functionality as it requires the Google AutoML Vision API. There is a demo of it above for your reference to see how it works!

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies in the root folder.
3. Go to the server file and install the dependencies.
4. If you do not have an SDK Manager or other android simulator installed, you can set it up following the instructions provide by Expo: <https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/android-studio-emulator>. If you would rather use an android phone, set the phone to developer mode
  - Go to settings.
  - Open "About Phone".
  - Tap the section "Build" 7 times.
  - Phone should notify you that it is now available for developer mode.
  - Connect a USB and install the Expo Application.
5. Open your terminal in linux (instructions for windows may be different).
6. Run "ifconfig" to locate your WIFI IP address (both laptop and phone need to be connected to the name network).
```js
Will look something like this
...
inet 192.168.0.15 ...
...
```
7. Create a "dev_port.json" file and enter the following object into the file:
```js
{
  "DEV_PORT": "http://[YourIPAddress]:5000",
}

example:
{
  "DEV_PORT": "http://http://192.168.0.15:5000",
}
```
8. Go to the server folder and run "npm run server" (this will start your server for the React Native application to make API calls to).
9. If using the phone, unlock your phone screen. With the simulator, ensure the program is open and running.
10. In a second terminal in the root folder, run "npm run android".
11. Ta Da! Your app should now be automatically loading on your phone or android simulator.

## Google API Set-up

Dependency: "@google-cloud/automl": "^0.1.3" (REQUIRED)

AutoML Vision API code is located in folder ~/server/automlvision.js .

AutoML account is required (unless developers set it up with a service key to the current auto ML vision module that is currently trained).

Credentials need to be passed through the './server/server.js' file through a hidden ENV folder. Specific information required are:
  - "PROJECT_ID": "xxxxxx",
  - "COMPUTE_REGION": "xxxxxx",
  - "MODEL_ID": "xxxxxx",

To gain access to the API, you also need to do the following in your terminal (Linux):
  - "export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CRENDENTIALS="[path to the service key]"
    - To verify that it has been entered correctly:
      - echo $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
  - "export PROJECT_ID="[google project id goes here]"
    - To verify that it has been entered correctly:
        - echo $PROJECT_ID
